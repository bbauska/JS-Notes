# JS-Notes
Work in Progress of Learning JavaScript. JS-Notes.

## Your First JavaScript Tutorial

Suppose you stated with your First JavaScript Tutorial which displays current date.
The JavaScript Code for this is:

```
1.	<button type="button" onclick="alert(Date())"> 
2.	    Click me to display Date and Time 
3.	</button> 
```

After reading this tutorial you should implement it on your own computer. Below are the implementation steps you should follow:

```
1.	Create a new web page.
2.	Add the button and the onclick event to it.
3.	Add the alert to show the date.
4.	Run the web page on your browser to test the feature you just created.
```

Now you know how to do implementation of your code.

### Which Editor should I use for JavaScript

As a beginner you will also ask how to write JavaScript code? You can use your windows notepad, or you can download notepad++ which is a very good editor.
However, the best Editor according to me would be Visual Studio Code which is very lightweight just 45 MB in size, and very-very powerful too. It is totally free of cost and runs on every operating system – windows, linux & mac.

### What should be covered on the Beginners level of JavaScript
#### The topics which you should cover are –

	1. JavaScript Syntax - JavaScript Syntax
	2. Variables - JavaScript Variables
	3. Data Types - JavaScript Data Types
	4. Operators - JavaScript Operators
	5. Arithmetic Operations - JavaScript Arithmetic
	6. Assignment - JavaScript Assignment
	7. JS Output - JavaScript Output
	8. Objects - JavaScript Objects
	9. Break & Continue - JavaScript Break and Continue

### Examples of JavaScript Programmes for Beginners
I would also like to list some programs which Beginners should implement.

	1. Create a program where user inputs 2 int values in 2 input boxes and you display the greatest of them on the alert box, when a button is clicked.
	2. Create a program where user enters a number in a text box and you should display its table (upto 10) on a div. The table should be created on the button click event. Also prevent user to enter string on the text box (give appropriate error on alert box when input is string).
	3. Create a small form for Job Application. It should have 5 fields – name, age, education, address and expected salary. These 5 fields should have HTML controls where user enter his/her information, there should be a button which on clicking shown the user information on a div controls.
	4. Finding whether a number is prime number or not.
	5. Create a calculator with common function – add, subtract, divide & multiply

</ol>

## What should be covered on the Advanced level of JavaScript
When you are on the Advanced level, this means you basically know how to work on JavaScript. In the Advanced level you have to deal with integration of JavaScript with applications created on Python, Ruby, PHP, ASP NET etc.

Here your job would be to make features on JavaScript that communicate efficiently with the Server technology like databases, Python, Ruby, PHP, ASP.NET Core, etc

### Some examples of advanced features made with JavaScript are:
	1. Partially updating parts of a web page from database every few seconds using AJAX.
	2. Get and show real time stock prices on the page. You can get the stock price by implementing the API with your JavaScript code.
	3. Creating interactive feature in your website so that conversion rates increases. Example can be an autocomplete feature which you can create with JavaSript.
	4. External API implementations like TMDB API in your JavaScript and helping users to get details of any movie, actor & series
	5. Infinite scroll or auto-paging feature

#### Conclusion
I only want to point you in the right directly so that you can learn JavaScript efficiently and at the same time you also love this web language.

### Patience #1!
	- Learn how to declare JS variables.
	- Learn basic variable types (number, string, array, and objects).
	- Learn Control Flow (if/else if/else, switch).
	- Learn basic loops (while, for).
	- Learn how to create and call basic functions.
	- Learn selectors (querySelector/ getElementBy).
	- Learn a bit more about objects, and start to understand how the DOM is made up of objects. 
	  It's important to note that you don't need to know this in depth at this point.
	- Mess with CSS using JavaScript. This is a great time to learn Javascript timing functions 
	  (setTimeout, setInterval).
	- Pick up jQuery for awhile. Profess that it's easier to learn to all your colleagues, write 
	  a bunch of small one off applications using an inordinate and unruly amount of code.
	- Try to learn how to do JQuery things in pure Javascript. Become frustrated at node methods 
	  and learn the difference between node arrays and node lists.
	- At some point get the hang of Javascript. Write everything in JavaScript, announce to all your
      colleagues that Javascript is better than jQuery, and then, later, stumble into compatibility 
	  issues with older browsers.
	- Fall back to jQuery for a bit. Then decide to write your own polyfills in JavaScript. Eventually realize this is taking forever and look for minimalistic libraries.
	- Start to learn intermediate concepts like closures and prototypical inheritance in the DOM. (I mean really understand it, not like when you were messing with css back in the day.).
	- Realize the importance of, and learn, architectural patterns like modules and event delegation. End up searching through piles of documentation on MVC getting more and more confused on what the latest trend in architectural frameworks is.
	- Mess around with different frameworks. Find out about this thing called Node and how it makes Javascript server side.
	- Download Node. Follow old tutorials, become super frustrated they don't work because they're two months out of date. Buy a book/somehow find a relevant article.
	- Work within the confines of the tutorial and book/ get overwhelmed at the differences between node JS and the JS you've been coding for forever.
	- Before really solidifying your knowledge of node, download 100s of libraries to make a chat program using express and http://socket.IO.
	- Feel super accomplished. Memorize how to make a node server. Start to look into build tools and templating.
	- Realize that the currently trending build tools differ depending on where you look. Try out Grunt/Gulp/Webpack and become annoyed at the incredibly convoluted setup.
	- Get pissed that you have to download a billion abstract libraries that require other libraries that require other libraries and so on ad infinitum.
	- Get really adept at reading documentation. Realize that MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) has a ton of information about JS methods and properties that you never noticed.
	- Learn about other DOM prototypal objects including Set and Generators.
	- Read up on the newest EcmaScript version. Try out fat arrows and new variable declarations.
	- Get mad at Microsoft for Ie and edge.
	- Learn about for of and for in loops.
	- Get madder at microsoft.
	- Learn about object destructoring.
	- Become irate with Microsoft.
	- Learn about Babel and Transpiling. You may have used it with the build tools, but you probably didn't understand it.
	- Learn about React. Learn about Redux. Learn about data stores and state. Perhaps even delve into the mutation object.
	- Keep falling down the rabbit hole and realize that however much you learn there will always be new trends in frameworks and architectures and best practices.

Keep in mind that a lot of these steps are slightly out of order and require relevant books/blog posts/articles/paid courses. Development isn't something you just learn and it's become this hugely popular thing as of late. You need to understand that a developer has to put in a ton of effort always, and because of that you really have to love it. Beyond the basics there are no magic amount of steps, and no clear path.

Too many people think this stuff is easy and once you learn you can quickly build whatever you want. Web Development, and especially Javascript, is hip like IPhones and Lattes. Truth is, it's a lot of constant work, and if that seems like your thing, I wish you the best of luck!
